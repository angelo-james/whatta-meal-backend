# Whatta Meal

A full-stack application that was built for the idea to give a user the ability to save their recipes for meals that they enjoyed cooking and eatting. No more forgotten recipes or misplacing them when they're on a piece of paper. Fututre feature would like to be able to add a social part to allow users to share with the community of other users.
